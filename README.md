# A repository for useful, static HTML pages and utilities

## [redirect.html](https://rainforestapp.github.io/toolbelt/redirect.html?to=https://www.rainforestqa.com)

Opens a blank page, then after 5s redirects to the URL given in the `to` query parameter. Use by visiting e.g. https://rainforestapp.github.io/toolbelt/redirect.html?to=https://example.com

This is can be useful e.g., when you want to visit a URL that doesn't normally change the browser content, but you do want the content to be changed (for instance to get rid of the QR code visible on the page before downloading a file).
